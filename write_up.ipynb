    "### Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "My pipeline consisted of 5 steps:- \n",
    "\n",
    "1) First, I converted the images to grayscale using opencv. This will help in edge detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Original image\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][imageOriginal]\n",
    "\n",
    "* Grayscale image\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][imageGrayscale]\n",
    "  \n",
    "2) Using Gaussian filter, Image was smoothen up.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gaussian image\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][imageGaussian]\n",
    "\n",
    "3) To detect edges & corners, Canny algorithm was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Canny image\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][imageCanny]\n",
    "\n",
    "4) line detection using hough method & area of interest in image was selected using masking method.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Masked image\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][imagemask]\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hough lines image\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][imageHough]\n",
    "\n",
    "5) The original image is overlaid with hough lines image  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Final image\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][imageweighted]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To draw the Single line on lane, i used following process:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1) X & Y coordinates of lines stored in array & slope of each line is calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Each slope checked with the threshold range limit & left/right side lane data was seprated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Intercept of each line calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Using Numpy function line was averaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Color and thickness were then applied to the averaged lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Followings are some potential shortcomings in my current pipeline:-\n",
    "  * Current algorithm can not handle rain condition/snow condition/dark night/vehicle crossing/bad road.\n",
    "  * Image should be clear with good resolution. Blurr image can cause a problem.\n",
    "  * Algorithm will have problem in detecting sharp turn road.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Followings are some improvement area :- \n",
    "  * Dynamic area of interest on road.\n",
    "  * Reduce nosie in lane detection\n",
    "  * Adding curve road lane detection algorithm "
